Originally the idea was to have the documentation, library, and tests in one project however this posed several problems.
 1. When building the library it included the test and documentation components in the build. These could've been moved 
    outside the src folder but it still left other problems. Like when building, would include the src/main.js and the
    index.html from the root directory. Another problem was not being able to show how rivet-vue could be used as an 
    embedded library directly in the html. The final decision was to use the documentation project as the embedded 
    library version and have the tests project as the esm version that you would get from npm.
