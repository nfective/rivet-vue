  Problem: When a component is updated in the library project the command `npm run build:library` has
           to be run for it to be reflected in the tests project. Apparently, npm link creates
           symbolic references to the project but the dist folder must be updated for the changes
           to be reflected
 Solution: Create a vite plugin in the tests project so that whenever there was a change in the library
           project it would be immediately be rebuilt. The problem is once there was an update, the
           watcher triggered a rebuild, which would then another rebuild, etc... creating an infinite
           loop even if the watcher wasn't watching the directory specifically
